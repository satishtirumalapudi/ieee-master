	         	IEEE-CBIT is a cutting edge platform to enhance and develop eminent skill sets on the upcoming technologies of the rising technical community. IEEE CBIT consists of two societies namely Power and Energy Society (PES) and Computer Society (CS). We also have an affinity group, Women In Engineering (WIE). IEEE-CBIT won the prestigious ‘Upcoming Student Branch’ award in Hyderabad Section Student Congress held in December 2017. 

				Student branch deals with the internal logistics and operations under supervision of an executive body formed every year by the students in the college. Each and every decision made by the executive body stays transparent without any veto power incongruous to the practices of anarchy. Entire student body is segregated into various line of works which are to be embarked on the interest basis of the members. 

				Our student branch is one of the most active branches in hyderabad section. IEEE-CBIT student branch strives every year in fulfilling the IEEE global community’s vision and maintain healthy relations with the student network team for a better and productive future. Established in 1993, our student branch provided innumerable opportunities to the members and fellow students on their journey to excellence. Till date, IEEE CBIT conducted ample of events, workshops and prolific activities. Many students shaped up their career by doing research and publishing papers on divergent fields via IEEE-CBIT. Vision, mission and exhibition are three pillars of IEEE-CBIT firmly embedded on our very foundation.

Gyandhan is a start-up by IIT Kanpur alumni, who have personally experienced financial constraints during their studies. They drew the tools needed to build a sustainable education financing offering from the several years they spent shaping credit strategies for Capital One, one of the biggest banks in the US. His talk spread awareness among the students who are considering MS abroad after their B.E at CBIT, about the various financial sources and aids that they could avail and how Gyandhan is willing to help them through the process. 
Gyandhan collaborated with leading banks across India like the State bank of India(SBI) and Axis bank. They help drafting easier and convenient methods of issuing student loans. They also designed an “Admit Predictable Model” based on the data of students who have studied in some of the universities of the US. This gives an idea of the universities which are more likely to accept student’s admission based on the criteria.  It was drawn mostly from personal experiences and so it was candid and quite informative.

Extremely large data sets that may be analysed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially relating to human behaviour and interactions.
AR(Augmented Reality):
A  technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.The computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.
Mixed Reality:
Mixed reality (MR), sometimes referred to as  reality, is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.
Artificial Intelligence:
The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
